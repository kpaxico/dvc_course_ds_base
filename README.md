# course-ds-base

## Preparation

### 1. Fork / Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iterative/course-ds-base.git
cd course-ds-base
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment

Create virtual environment named `dvc-venv` (you may use other name)

```bash
python3 -m venv dvc-venv
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PWD" >> dvc-venv/bin/activate
source dvc-venv/bin/activate
```

Install python libraries

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add Virtual Environment to Jupyter Notebook

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dvc-venv
```

Configure ToC for jupyter notebook (optional)

```bash
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
```

## 3. Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 4. Push DVC data

If you'd like to test commands like [`dvc push`](https://man.dvc.org/push),
that require write access to the remote storage, the easiest way would be to set
up a "local remote" on your file system:

> This kind of remote is located in the local file system, but is external to
> the DVC project.

```console
mkdir -p /tmp/dvc_course_ds_base_storage
dvc remote add -d local /tmp/dvc_course_ds_base_storage
```

You should now be able to run:

```console
dvc push
```

Or by specifying the remote:

```console
dvc push -r local
```
